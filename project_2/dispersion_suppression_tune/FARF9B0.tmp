! Dispersion section design

parameter[particle] = proton
parameter[p0c] = 10.0 * 1e9
parameter[geometry] = closed

circumference=200.0
n=5.0 !number of cells per half-ring 
lcell=circumference/n/2
ldip=8.0 !dipole length, we use 80% packing fraction, 16 m per 20-m cell
lq=1.0 !quad length (when we get to thick lenses)
ld=0.5 ! drift length

kf=0.1 !some initial values
kd=-0.1

qf: quadrupole, l=lq, k1 = kf
qd: quadrupole, l=lq, k1 = kd
d: drift, l = ld
dipole1: sbend, l=ldip, angle=pi/n/2
! dipole angle: 2 dipoles per cell, n cells per half-ring
! half angle dipole used for dispersion supperssion
! that only works with mux=muy=90 degrees:
dipole2: sbend, l=ldip, angle=pi/(n+2)/2
dipole_ds: sbend, l=ldip, angle=pi/(n+2)/4
! these are our theta1 and theta2 angles (theta1=theta2=theta/2 for mux=muy=90 degrees)

! for thick lenses we will need to split the quad into two
! only for thin lens approximation
cell_ring: line = (qf, d, dipole1, d, qd, d, dipole1, d)

cell_racetrack: line = (qf, d, dipole2, d, qd, d, dipole2, d)

! dipole with half-strength (mux=muy=90 deg!)
cell_ds: line = (qf, d, dipole_ds, d, qd, d, dipole_ds, d)

! straight cell, no dipoles => drifts
cell_straight: line = (qf, 2*d, qd, 2*d)

half_ring: line = (5*cell_racetrack)

ring: line = (2*half_ring)

ds: line = (2*cell_ds)

straight: line = (5*cell_straight) ! long-ish straight section (5 FODO cells)

half_racetrack: line = (5*cell_racetrack)

racetrack: line = (half_racetrack,ds,straight,ds,half_racetrack,ds,straight,ds)
